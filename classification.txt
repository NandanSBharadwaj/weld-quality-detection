Weld Defect classification using Machine Learning Models

This project is a machine learning-based system for detecting and classifying weld defects from images. It allows real-time predictions using Random Forest and Decision Tree classifiers trained on labeled weld images. The model improves over time with user feedback, making it both adaptive and accurate.

Features:
Supports custom categories for classification
Trains using Random Forest and Decision Tree classifiers
Accepts image inputs and returns predicted classes with probabilities

Each image includes:
Class-wise probability percentages
Predicted class
